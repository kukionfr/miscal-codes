# SeeTalker
SeeTalker gives Amazon's Alexa the ability to tell you what it sees. SeeTalker is triggered by Alexa requests to describe what it sees or take a selfie. SeeTalker calls Microsoft's Face API and Vision Services API to interpret video images, returning a natural language response using Alexa.

SeeTalker was developed by the original developer to explore image recognition and Alexa skill development. The develper also learned Python along the way and how to utlize a Raspberry Pi as a web server and IoT device.

Key learning opportunities from SeeTalker:
1.	Alexa skill development
2.	Utilize Raspberry Pi as a web server
3.	Microsoft Cognitive Services: Face API, Vision Services API
4.	Alexa skills directives
5.	Sending Email
6.	Python Flask and Amazon Ask web services framework (Flask-Ask)
